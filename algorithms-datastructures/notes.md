## Loop invariant
Property of an algorithm.
- Initialization: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.
- Maintenance: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.
- Termination: The loop terminates, and when it terminates, the invariant, along with the reason that the loop terminated - gives us a useful property that helps us show that the algorithm is correct.

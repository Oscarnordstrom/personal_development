Q: Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that
requires Ã»nding the shortest distance between two points.

A: Quickly finding n-largest/smallest element in a collection. Finding fastest way to travel between two cities.

# 1.1-2
Memory efficiency, if algorithm is in-place or requires additional memory allocations.

# 1.1-3
Array: fast to iterate through if it is contiguous, fast lookup if you know which index you want. Slow to push elements to the front, since it requires reallocation of the entire array.

# 1.1-4
Both are path finding algorithms, shortest-path seeks the minimal distance traveled between two points while traveling-salesperson requires that every node in a graph is visited.

# 1.1-5
Priority ordering for hospital patients.

# 1.1-6
Finding the n-largest items from a day's purchases for a store, or finding the current n-largest items during the day.

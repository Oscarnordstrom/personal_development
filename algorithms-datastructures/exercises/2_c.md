Loop invariant: At the start of each loop index i, the total sum consists of the sum of the elements for A[1:i-1].

- Initialization: The sum starts at 0, representing the sum of zero elements.
- Maintenance: Each increment of `i` preserves the sum of the previous subarray.
- Termination: The loop terminates after adding the last element to the sum.

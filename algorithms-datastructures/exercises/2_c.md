Loop invariant: At the start of each loop index i, the total sum consists of the sum of the elements for A[1:i-1].

- Initialization: The sum starts at 0, representing the sum of zero elements.
- Maintenance: Each increment of `i` preserves the sum of the previous subarray.
- Termination: The loop terminates after adding the last element to the sum.

# 2.1-4

Pseudocode:

```
Linear-Search(A, n, v)
value_index = NIL
for i = 1 to n
  if A[i] == v
    value_index = i
    return value_index
return value_index

```

Loop invariant: At the start of each loop, the value has not been found yet.

- Initialization: The value has not been found, since no values have been searched.
- Maintenance: Each increment of `i` guarantees that the value has not been found, as the algorithm halts when the value has been found.
- Termination: The loop terminates when all values has been visited. If the search value has not been found, the algorithm always returns a NIL value.

# 2.1-5

Pseudocode:

```
ADD-BINARY-INTEGERS(A, B, C, n)
carry = 0
for i = 0 to n
  C[i] = carry
  if A[i] == 1 and B[i] == 1
    carry = 1
  else if A[i] == 1 or B[i] == 1
    C[i] = 1
    carry = 0
  else {
    carry = 0
  }
  C[n] = carry

return C
```

$O(n^3)$

# 2.2-2

- Loop invartiant: Same as insertion sort, left subarray is sorted throughout all iterations.
- It only needs to compare the second to last element, as the last element is guaranteed to be in sorted order.
- Approximately $n^2 + a*n + b$ instructions, therefore $O(n^2)$.
- Worst case is not better, this algorithm does not change depending on the input.

# 2.2-3

- Average runtime: Half of input
- Worst: Entire input
- Average and worst: $O(n)$

# 2.2-4

Linear search through the array once to check if it is sorted, if not sort it afterwards.

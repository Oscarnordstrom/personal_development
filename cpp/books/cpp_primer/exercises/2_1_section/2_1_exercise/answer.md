long at least as large as an int, and long long at least as large as long.
- The difference between signed and unsigned is that signed primitive types are able to be set values below 0. An unsigned type with the same amount of bits is able to take on an equal amount of values, but ranging from 0 upwards.
- The difference between a float and a double is the minimum precision of the digits. A double has a precision of 10 digits while a float has a precision of 6 digits.

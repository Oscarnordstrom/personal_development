The default constructor for Disc_quote is necessary because it allows the derived class Bulk_quote to use the default constructor when creating objects of type Bulk_quote. If the default constructor for Disc_quote were removed, the derived class Bulk_quote would no longer have access to a default constructor and would be unable to create objects of type Bulk_quote using the default constructor. This would limit the ways in which Bulk_quote objects can be created, potentially impacting the flexibility and usability of the class.

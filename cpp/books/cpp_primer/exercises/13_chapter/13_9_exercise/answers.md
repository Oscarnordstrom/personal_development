A destructor is a special member function in C++ that is used to perform cleanup tasks when an object of a class is about to be destroyed. It is the opposite of a constructor, which is called when an object is created.

The synthesized destructor, also known as the default destructor, is automatically generated by the compiler if a class does not have an explicitly defined destructor. Its purpose is to free up any resources held by the object before it is destroyed. This can include releasing dynamically allocated memory, closing files, releasing locks, or any other cleanup operations that may be necessary.

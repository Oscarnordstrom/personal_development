The parameter to the save and remove members of Message is defined as Folder& instead of Folder or const Folder& for efficiency reasons.

If the parameter were defined as Folder, it would require making a copy of the Folder object every time save or remove is called, which could be expensive depending on the size and complexity of the Folder object.

If the parameter were defined as const Folder&, it would prevent modification of the Folder object within the save and remove members. However, these members need to modify the Folder object by adding or removing the Message from it.

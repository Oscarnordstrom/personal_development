1. numbered a: This creates an object 'a' of the numbered class, which generates a unique serial number and assigns it to the data member 'mysn' of 'a'.

2. numbered b = a: This creates an object 'b' of the numbered class and initializes it with the copy constructor using 'a'. Since the copy constructor is synthesized, it will copy the value of 'mysn' from 'a' to 'b', resulting in 'b' having the same serial number as 'a'.

3. numbered c = b: This creates an object 'c' of the numbered class and initializes it with the copy constructor using 'b'. Again, the copy constructor will copy the value of 'mysn' from 'b' to 'c', resulting in 'c' having the same serial number as 'b' and 'a'.

4. f(a): This calls the function 'f' with the object 'a'. The function prints the value of 'mysn' of the passed object, which is the serial number of 'a'.

5. f(b): This calls the function 'f' with the object 'b'. The function prints the value of 'mysn' of the passed object, which is the serial number of 'b'.

6. f(c): This calls the function 'f' with the object 'c'. The function prints the value of 'mysn' of the passed object, which is the serial number of 'c'.

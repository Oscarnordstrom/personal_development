If the synthesized versions of the copy-control members were used in the Message class, it would lead to incorrect behavior. The synthesized copy constructor and copy assignment operator would perform a shallow copy of the folders member, resulting in two Message objects sharing the same set of folders. This would cause problems when one of the objects is destroyed or modified, as it would affect the other object's set of folders.

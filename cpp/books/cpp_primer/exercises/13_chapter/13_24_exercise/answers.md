If the version of HasPtr in this section didn't define a destructor, it would lead to a memory leak. The HasPtr class dynamically allocates memory for the string member ps using new. Without a destructor, this memory would not be released when a HasPtr object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. As a result, the memory allocated for the string would remain allocated, leading to a memory leak.

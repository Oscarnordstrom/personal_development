Copy and swap is not used to define the Message assignment operator because the folders member of the Message class is a set of pointers. Using the copy and swap idiom would involve making a copy of the set of pointers, which would not copy the actual Folder objects but only the pointers to them. This would result in two Message objects pointing to the same set of Folder objects, leading to problems when one of the objects is modified or destroyed.

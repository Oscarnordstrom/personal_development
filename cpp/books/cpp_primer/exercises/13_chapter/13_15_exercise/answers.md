If the numbered class has a copy constructor that generates a new serial number instead of copying the existing one, it will change the output of the calls in the previous exercise. The reason is that when objects are copied, the copy constructor will generate a new unique serial number for each object, resulting in different serial numbers for 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

When we assign one StrBlob to another, the underlying smart pointer is copied. However, the vector to which the pointer points is not copied, resulting in both StrBlob objects using the same vector. This may not be the desired behavior if we want separate vectors for each StrBlob.

On the other hand, when we assign one StrBlobPtr to another, a similar process occurs as with StrBlob assignment. The smart pointer is copied, and both StrBlobPtr objects will refer to the same vector. This behavior may be intentional and desirable if we want multiple StrBlobPtr instances to point to the same vector.

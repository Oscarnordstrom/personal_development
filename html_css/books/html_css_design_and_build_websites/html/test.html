 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
 an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
 of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
 the other scientific journals her work had
 appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
 The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
 since college, and the longer she spent in these
 four walls the more she felt she needed to be
 free.</p>
<blockquote>
    He was uncontained.
</blockquote>
 <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
 sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
 proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
 people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
 many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
 the secrets of the llama <abbr
 title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
 outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
 she had something better to do.</p>

    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a
    recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1tbs butter</li>
    <li>2tbs cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium
    heat</li>
    <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
    <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
    <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of
    the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if
    you are making an omelette)</li>
    <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the
    heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
    until served)</li>
    </ol>
